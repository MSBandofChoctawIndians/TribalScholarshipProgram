4:T4c6,The Tribal Scholarship Program will assist the students in the application process dealing with the colleges /universities. Students need to apply for admission to the college/university of their choice months before the college term begins. It is recommended that new students apply to several colleges/universities in their senior year in high school. Students should also apply for housing (dorm) at the same time they apply for admission. Students must work closely with their College Financial Aid Office as well the Business Office. For full-time students, the College Financial Aid Office will need to send to the Tribal Scholarship Office the Financial Aid Package Form. The College Financial Aid Officewill need the Student Aid Report (SAR) from the completed FAFSA in order to complete the Financial Aid Package Form. Full-time student awards for the Tribal Scholarship Program cannot be processed without the completed Financial Aid Package Form from the college/university. Also, an application is considered incomplete if all the supporting documents are not in the student's file at the Tribal Scholarship Office. An incomplete application or an application received after the deadline will not be processed.0:["Muy3xvEFTTVXW938Zl7sO",[[["",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",["$","section",null,{"className":"top-[-40px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"top-4 mx-auto max-w-[1024px] bg-background px-4 pb-4 text-foreground sm:px-6 lg:px-2","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-slate mx-auto max-w-none pt-4 md:prose-lg lg:prose-xl dark:prose-invert","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"width":1024,"height":336,"src":"./image/tspstaff2.webp","alt":"Tribal Scholarship Program Staff","className":"!mt-0"}],["$","h1",null,{"children":"About Us"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has consistently placed education as a high priority and emphasized the importance of increasing the number of students entering and completing post-secondary educational programs.
